## 🚀 Download this fork

🔗 **[Download APK from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/innna327-source/rikkahub-Jude/releases)**

Do not use **Code → Download ZIP** if you only want to install the app; that downloads source code, not an APK.

The default debug build is a universal APK. Back up your data before installation. Because this fork and the
official app may use different signing certificates, Android might not allow installing one directly over the other.
If Android reports a signature conflict, export a backup before uninstalling any existing version.

For official builds, visit the [upstream RikkaHub project](https://github.com/rikkahub/rikkahub).

## 🌿 Maintained changes in this fork

- **Automatic rolling summaries and context compression**: keep recent messages while continuously compressing
  older visible history, with editable summaries and configurable target length.
- **Long-conversation chunking**: large histories and existing summaries are compressed in bounded chunks instead
  of being sent as one oversized request.
- **Dedicated compression API and model**: optionally use a separate OpenAI-compatible endpoint, API key, model,
  Chat Completions path, or Responses API for compression.
- **Dedicated OCR API and model**: OCR can use its own OpenAI-compatible endpoint and model without changing the
  normal chat provider.
- **Paragraph-level TTS controls**: play assistant replies paragraph by paragraph, with quoted-text-only,
  English-only, and automatic playback options.
- **Usage statistics and reminders**: local app-usage views and configurable duration reminders.
- **Moments**: an assistant-scoped social timeline with AI-generated likes, comments, deletion, date filtering,
  and manual refresh diagnostics.
- **Anonymous question box**: assistant-scoped anonymous questions, delayed AI answers, one-time user answers,
  and follow-up AI comments.
- **Backup and release maintenance**: compatibility fixes for newer backups, local file restoration, request logs,
  universal debug APK packaging, and update checks that prefer the universal package.

Unless a release note says otherwise, this fork retains the upstream RikkaHub features listed below.

Git metadata; they do not identify the owner or maintainer of this fork. The upstream project and its contributors
retain credit for their original work. Changes listed in **Maintained changes in this fork** are the scope maintained
in this repository.
